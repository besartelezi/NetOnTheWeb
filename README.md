# Surfing the dotWeb with .Net
This project is a small lil' project where I explore the generated folder structure and learn the following:
* How to start a webApp project
* How to add extra pages
* How to add a model

## Intro to .NET - Setting goals
Before starting out with this assignment, I have been programming a bit with C# by making a very simple banking application.
So C# itself is something I'm comfortable with.
But .NET is something completely new.
So my goals for now are to finish the MVP necessary for this project, and then play around a little with the site.
With playing around, I mean just adding pages, editing those pages, and really seeing how .NET really works.

## Learning Stuff - The B.E.S.A.R.T. Way
I'm half reading the microsoft documentation, and half working on/figuring out stuff by myself.
I found that just doing stuff until you hit a hurdle, and **THEN** start doing some research/reading is the best way for me to learn.
If I don't have a specific goal or something that I want to solve when reading the Microsoft documentation, I figured most information will just leave my brain.
But if I'm looking up something because I've been stuck somewhere for a half-hour, I will never forget the mistakes I made and the lessons I've learned from it.
So I came up with the B.E.S.A.R.T. learning method:

<!-- I came up with this method for two reasons: I really, really enjoy this way of learning and I enjoy inventing new acronyms even more -->
* **B**: Be yourself (try figuring it out on your own)
* **E**: Embrace your own shortcomings (if ya can't figure it out ya just can't figure it out)
* **S**: Seek the information you need (Google)
* **A**: Apply the newly found information to solve your problems (don't just copy paste the answer, understand what went wrong)
* **R**: Really feel good because you finally solved the issue (finally solving an issue feels **REALLY** good) 
* **T**: Truly embrace your mistakes and never forget what you learned (don't forget how painful it felt to make the mistake, and how good it felt to finally figure it out)

## Back to Coding
After a small break from learning .NET, I'm happy to announce that I have once again returned! And boy did I return! I think taking a small break from learning C# was necessary. Because of it, I really learned that coding is a lot like breathing, if you don't do it often, something bad might happen! And in this case, that bad thing is remembering how to code. So I'm glad I experienced this for myself, since this was a very necessary wake-up call.
